utter_en_covid_preexisting_illness,custom_0,html,"<p>Population groups that have been more frequently reported having severe disease and death include people above 60 years of age, males, people with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. The proportion of most of the reported chronic diseases and health conditions is similar to the prevalence of these conditions in the elderly age groups in China, therefore they might be surrogates of increasing age only. Higher ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme II) gene expression may be linked to higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown that ACE 2 expression in lung tissues increases with age, tobacco use and with some hypertensive treatment. These observations might explain the vulnerability of older people, tobacco users/smokers and those with hypertension; they also highlight the importance of identifying smokers as a potential vulnerable group for COVID-19.<a href='https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf' target='_blank'>(1)</a></p>"
